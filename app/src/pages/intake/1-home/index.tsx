          Once you complete the steps here to register for In-Person Identity
          proofing, a confirmation case number will be created and emailed to
          you. This case number will be valid for 10 days. You will need to
          share it when you come in-person to verify your identity at a VA
          Medical Center. You can write your case number down, print the email,
          or show it from your mobile device. If you go to a VA Medical Center
          after the 10 days have passed, the case number will no longer be valid
          and you will need to sign in to your Login.gov account and repeat the
          process to register for In-Person Identity Proofing again.
